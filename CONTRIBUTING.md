# How to Contribute

Sorry, we don't take contributions to the main DeepVariant codebase at the
moment. We expect to open the project for contributions in 1H 2018 after we
configure continuous integration testing on github, formalize the external code
review process, among other technical tasks to ensure that the DeepVariant
codebase maintains its current high quality coding and testing standards.

In the meantime, please feel free to fork the DeepVariant codebase and prepare
in your fork any patches you'd eventually like to contribute and let us know
about them so we can prioritize putting the necessary infrastructure in place
to accept external contributions.
